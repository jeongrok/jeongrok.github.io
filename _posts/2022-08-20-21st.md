# *Permutation in String*

Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.


#### Example

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"

Output: true

Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").


### Approach 1: 




### Implementation:

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:


    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        
        
```
