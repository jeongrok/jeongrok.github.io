Python Basics

* How to input multiple values from users in one line

```python
x,y = input(), input()

## or

a,b = input().split()
print(a)
print(b)
```

    20 30
    a b
    c d
    c
    d


* How to typecast built-in function input( )

input( ) function returns a string, so users can typecase to an int or a float.

* What is list comprehension

List comprehension is another way to define and create a list in python.
List comprehension consists of: 
1. Output Expression
2. Input Sequence
3. A variable representing a member of the input sequence
4. optional predicate part
              


```python
## list of odd squares from 1 to 10 using list comprehension

odd_square = [x ** 2 for x in range(1,11) if x % 2 == 1]
print(odd_square)
```

    [1, 9, 25, 49, 81]



```python
## same as the code above
odd2 = []
for x in range(1,11):
    if x % 2 == 1:
        odd2.append(x**2)
print(odd2)
```

    [1, 9, 25, 49, 81]


* Python Operators

    * Arithmetic Operators 
        * Arithmetic Operators differ from those of Java in that divison "/" divides into a float and "//" divides with respect to floor rule (similar to that of division in Java.)
    
    * Comparison Operators
        * ">=, <=" : the order matters for these greater than or less than signs
    
    * Logical Operators
        * Compared to Java operators, Python uses the words "and", "or", and "not" for denoting logical operators
    
    * Identity Operator
        * "is" and "is not" are the identity operators both used to check if tow values are located on the same part of the memory
    
    * Membership Operators
        * "in" and "not in" are the membership operators both used to test whether a value or variable is in a sequence
        * Sequence in Python are list, tuple, and range

* Writing ternary in Python


```python
## Java
## int a = 20 > 10? 1 : 0;

## Python
a = 1 if 20 > 10 else 0
```

* How is "==" and "is" operator different in Python

"==" is a comparison operator that compares values, whereas the "is" operator is the identity operator that checks whehter the operands refer to the same object or not (same memory location.)

* Data Types in Python

    * Strings
        * immutable
        * String.endswith() --> returns true if a string ends with the given suffix otherwise, returns False
        * String.startswith()
        * str.format()
        * str.count
        * str.strip()
        
    * Lists
        * uses "[ ]"
        * mutable --> dynamically sized arrays (similar to ArrayList)
        * does not need to be homogeneous
        * may contain duplicate values with their distinct positions
        * used for implementing stacks and queues
        * append() --> adds one element to the list
        * insert('position', 'value') --> adds element at specified index
        * extend() --> adds multiple elements at the end of the list
        * reverse()
        * remove() --> removes a specific element in the list
        * pop() --> removes and returns the last element of the list
        * len() --> returns the size of the list
        * map('function', 'iter') --> returns a list of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable
        * lambda() --> this function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned
        
    * Tuples
        * uses "( )"
        * sequenece of immutable Python objects
        * a little bit faster than lists
    *
