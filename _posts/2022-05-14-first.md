# My First Post

In this blog, I will upload the things I have learned each and everyday.
I am certain that this habit will make me more organized, enhance my communication skills, and be more grateful.
Looking back at these posts one day, I know that I will be thankful to myself for not giving up.

## What I Learned

### Github
* How to make a Github Page
* Posting my first blog

### Machine Learning

I have learned about the overview of what is taught at CS229: Machine Learning, an online course taught by Andrew Ng at Stanford University.

* Well-Posed Learning: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T , as measured by P improves with experience E.
* Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
* Regression vs Classification Problem -> Continuous and Discrete Explanatory Variable
* Support Vector Machine: Using infinite number of input feature through something called **kernel**.
* Reinforcement Learning
