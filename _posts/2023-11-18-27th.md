# *Git Basics*

Learning how to create a stable repository so it does not crash when having multiple branches for a project

```python
la
```

Short-hand form of ls -la

Shows all the files including hidden ones

.git is a folder that stores all the commits and changes in the history of the repository

```python
git status
```

shows updates that haven't been saved

```python
git add .
```

stages all untracked and updated files

```python
git commit -m "meaningful messages"
```

please include the what and why you committed

```python
git push
```

post this git live on a remote repository where my project is hosted

```python
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jyu673@gatech.edu"
```

Generates a ssh key

```python
ls | grep <name of the key>
```

Helps to get the key

```python
cat <name of the key>.pub
```

```python
git init
```

Initialize empty git repository in this current directory

```python
git remote add origin <ssh-link>
git remote -v
git push -u origin master
```

Adds reference to remote repository

Checking any remote repositories connected to the current one

Makes the default upstream to push (which is origin)

```python
git branch
```

Looks at different branches

```python
git checkout -b <name of branch>
```

Makes a new branch

```python
git diff <branch>
```

Looks at the changes that have been made when compared to <branch>

```python
git pull origin master
```

Fetches commits from the master branch of the origin remote (into the local origin/master branch), and then it merges origin/master into the branch you currently have checked out

```python
git branch -d <name of branch>
```

Deletes branch

```python
git commit -am 'message'
```

Works with modified files

Stash --> temporary holding place

```python
git merge <name of branch>
```

Merges with the <name of branch

```python
git reset
```

Unstaging (undo add)

```python
git reset HEAD~1
```

Undo commit

```python
git add -p <filename>
```

Patch level git

How to deal with merge conflicts:
merge, rebase, pull, cherry-pick, stash apply ...
