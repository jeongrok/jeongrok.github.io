# *Group Anagrams*


#### Example



### Approach 1: 



### Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        h = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for word in strs:
            h[tuple(sorted(word))].append(word)
        return h.values()
        
        
```

#### Complexity Analysis:


### Reflection

I think the key part of this question is thinking about what can be stored in a dictionary as key (immutable object) and value (mutable object).

While I knew I had to use ascii code, I could not think of this implementation and manipulation. I think it was a great exercise!
