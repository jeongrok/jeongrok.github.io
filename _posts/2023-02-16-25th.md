# *Linked List*

Linked list is a linear data structure that are linked using pointers.
Linked lists have nodes that are connected to each other. 
Each node has data and the address of the next node.


Unlike array, the size of linked list is dynamic and insertion/deletion is easy by traversing through the head of the list.
However, random access is impossible and there will be extra memory due to the pointer in the linked list.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
        
        
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

## Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.


#### Example

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]


### Approach 1: 

For linked list, I must always be careful about the case where there are 0 elements, only 1, and two elements within the linked list.

Given this, I will implement the iterative and the recursive implementation of reversed linked list.


### Implementation:

```python
# iterative
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
       prev, curr = None, head
       while curr:
           temp = curr.next
           curr.next = prev
           prev = curr
           curr = temp
           
       return prev
        
```

```python
# recursive
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
       if not head:
           return None
       
       newH = head
       if head.next:
           newH = self.reverseList(head.next)
           head.next.next = head
       head.next = None
       return NewH
        
```

#### Complexity Analysis:

O(n) for time complexity

O(1) for space complexity when implemented with iterative approach, O(n) when recursive
