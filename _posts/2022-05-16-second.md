## Reflection
I was determined to post every day this summer about the things I have learned each and every day, but failed on the second day. While not keeping the promise I made to myself once can be considered as a mistake, repeating to keep failing cannot. I will make sure to not let this blog be a failure, but a  progress.

## What I Learned

### Github

* How to add category, tags to my blog
* How to add table of contents to my blog

### DSA in Python

* Some standard data types of Python:
*   Numbers (int, float, long, complex)...
*   String --> 
*   Some built-in functions regarding String: .strip() ~ .trim(), .count("")
*   List "[ ]"
*   Tuple "( )" --> immutable list, but slightly more efficient
*   Dictionary "[key : value, ...]"
*   Set
*   ...

### ML

* What is parameter?
* M = number of training examples
* X = inputs = features = attributes
* Y = outputs = target variable
* N = number of features in our training sample
* What is Gradient Descent?
* Batch Gradient Descent vs Stochastic Gradient Descent?
* What is normal equation and how do you derive normal equation?
