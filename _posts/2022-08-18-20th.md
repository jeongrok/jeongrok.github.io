# *Minimum Window Substring*

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window.

If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".


#### Example

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"

Output: "BANC"

Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.


### Approach 1: 




### Implementation:

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:


    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        dict_t = Counter(t)
        have = {}
        required = len(dict_t)
        left = right = unique_chars = 0
        ans = len(s) + 1, None, None
        while right < len(s):
            char = s[right]
            have[char] = have.get(char,0) + 1
            if char in dict_t and dict_t[char] == have[char]:
                unique_char += 1
            while left <= right and unique_char == required:
                charleft = s[left]
                if right - left + 1 < ans[0]:
                    ans = (right - left + 1, left, right)
                    have[charleft] -= 1
                    if charleft in dict_t and have[charleft] < dict_t[charleft]:
                        unique_char -= 1
                    left += 1
                right += 1
                
        return s[ans[1]:ans[2] + 1] if ans[0] < len(s) + 1 else ""
        
```


#### Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(2S + T)

Space Complexity: O(S + T)


### Reflection

My first hard question, it was hard to understand at first, but got it!
