# *Longest Substring without Repeat*



#### Example


### Approach 1: 


### Implementation:

```python
class Solution:


    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        h = {}
        i = result = 0
        for j in range(len(s)):
            if s[j] in h:
                i = max(i, h[s[j]])
            h[s[j]] = j+1
            result = max(result, j - i + 1)
        return result
        
```
