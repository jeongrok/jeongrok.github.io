## Pythonic Thinking

### 1. Know the version of your Python
```python
import sys
print(sys.version_info)
print(sys.version)
```


### 2. Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide

- Within a file, function and classes should be seperated by 2 blank lines
- In a class, methods should be seperated by 1 blank line
- For type annotations, ensure that there is no separation between the variable name and the colon, and use a space before the type information

```python
import numpy as np


def element_wise_add(data1: np.ndarray, data: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    return data1 + data
```

- Protected instance attributes should be in *_leading_underscore* format
- Private instance attributes should be in *__double_leading_underscore* format
- Module-level constraints should be in *ALL_CAPS* format
- Instance methods in classes should use *self*, which refers to the object, as the name of the first parameter
- Don't check for empty containers or sequences by comparing the length to zero (*if len(somelist) == 0*). Use *if not somelist* and assume that empty values will implicitly evaluate to False
- Always put import statements at the top of a file
- Always use absolute names when importing them, not names relative to the current module's own path. (*from bar import foo, not just from . import foo*)


### 3. Know the difference between *bytes* and *str*
- Instances of bytes contain raw, unsigned 8-bit values (often in ASCII encoding)
- Instances of str contain Unicode code points that represent textual characters from human language
- To convert Unicode data to binary data, you must call encode method, and to convert binary to Unicode, you must call the decode method

```python
# Takes a str or bytes and always returns a str
def to_str(bytes_or_str):
    if isinstance(bytes_or_str, bytes):
        value = bytes_or_str.decode('utf-8')
    else:
        value = bytes_or_str
    return value

# Takes a str or bytes and always returns a byte
def to_byte(bytes_or_str):
    if isinstance(bytes_or_str,str):
        value = bytes_or_str.encode('utf-8')
    else:
        value = bytes_or_str
    return value
```

- Write and read a file with ('wb','rb') if the file is written in binary mode (bytes)

### 4. Prefer Interpolated F-Strings over C-style format Strings and str.format
